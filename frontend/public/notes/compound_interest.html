  <h1>Compound Interest Explained</h1>
  <p>Compound interest is interest calculated on the initial principal and also on the accumulated interest of previous periods.</p>
  <h2>Formula</h2>
  <p>Final amount = P (1 + r/n)^(n*t), where P = principal, r = annual rate, n = compounding periods per year, t = years.</p>
  <h2>Example</h2>
  <p>If you invest $1,000 at 5% annually compounded yearly, after 10 years you'll have $1,000*(1.05)^10 ≈ $1,629.</p>
  <h2>Key takeaway</h2>
  <p>Start early — compounding grows faster over longer horizons.</p>
